manualdata;;The water was all over the counter and the dining room wrecked and looked as though it hadn't  been bussed in more than a few hours.. And the Chinese burrito ist a pure joke. The portions are plentiful and I only had a ten minute wait. Whether its supposed to be a bland noodle bowl or a spicy Kung Pao dish, they all taste the exact same. The prices way too high compared to the bad quality ingredients it futs in its food. They have very polite staff. This restaurant serves such delicious food. The pho broth was tasteless, with very little good meat bits. The food is great and the prices are very affordable, especially for the amount of food you receive. it is COMPLETELY devoid of any atmosphere. place was dirty and we found something in our vegetable low Keon that was neither vegetable or noodle. Friendly folks here. Their vegetarian selection on the Chinese food menu is extremely limited. Our table was filthy, the floor was sticky, and the whole experience was generally unpleasant. I'm stuck drinking nasty tapwater with my mediocre Chinese food. The service is over the top. People there are friendly, and I always make it a point to say hi to who I believe is the owner and his wife that cook in the back. Host was friendly and welcomed us to the neighborhood as we mentioned we had just moved to the area. driver was late and had to be brought to my home like a jet landing at airport. The place is spanking new, very spacious, lots of seating. Ambiance was nice, facility was clean, restrooms clean. Awesome environment. Food was cold. They have more than ample parking.. This place is top for the price. I loved the chars - they were very comfortable. Food was mediocre at best and a bit pricey. There's plenty of parking, indoor and outdoor seating and the place is really clean. The Thai Tea was amazing and as refreshing as the spring roll. it is lacking parking spots. Service is friendly and the place itself remains clean, spacious, and bright as before. Such a good deal.. Not be degraded and harassed by a lazy waiter. I liked the soft served tasty ice cream. They are very inexpensive and huge portions. Pleasant surroundings and a huge menu with some pretty wild stuff. impressive buffet selection. This is the worst Chinese food I have ever eaten. Service is very courteous and very fast with taking your plates and refilling your water while you're getting the next plate. The food also lacks seasoning. *Plus the dress code of the guys working there.. sweat pants, t shirt, gangster style hat..it is a joke. No noise for one was awesome. BIG helpings, SCRUMPTIOUS  food and personal service, in a nice family setting. we had gotten a great value for our money. The Mongolian Beef was so good it was ridiculous.. *They have gotten our cards/orders mixed up with another customer's before. It smells over there pretty bad if u want to dine in. crappuffs were undercooked. Portion size was beyond ample with leftovers of both. The people who work here are efficient. Great food, nice staff, fast delivery. All dishes are so flavorful and well made. My first impression was meeting the nice waiter and i think the owner. Food is extremely bad and the server's attitude is really bad. *The food is very pricey.  I will say give this one a solid 3 star due to the fact that some dishes are not authentic enough. The beef dishes are terrible. the restrooms are teeny tiny. I was not really impressed with the food. The owner has great interior taste. Excellent value for the $, but maybe the person answering the phone could have a bit less attitude,. They of course had many of the Chinese buffet staples and they also tasted great. *The food comes fast too. The food is generally good to very good but a little inconsistent. The beef was lacking in flavor. Great value for your buck.  I love the Kung Pow chichen. this establishment is awful. The atmosphere is comfortable. Yummy! We ordered takeout and it is FANTASTIC. the place's dï¿½cor is disastrous. A green bean with black bean sauce, that was mushy and bland. The place has a very positive vibe to it. the king pow was hot and tasteless. This location is VERY clean and the food is always hot & tastes fresh.. *I totally dig the hot and sour soup. First time chow mein was burned. Service is nice. They have great student discounts at this place. The onions were crispy and the beef full of flavor. The egg foo young was a dry, flavorless, seemingly premade patty.  Chinese Soul food indeed, and perhaps the best wings in town.. I have been there twice and the service was lacking. def not what it use to be and the service was terrible. The spring roll and crab puffs were very oily. The owner was very rude and yelled at me in Chinese. Your water glass is never empty. Familystyle Tofu..which was a horrible spices sauce over Tofu. The first opening months usually has very long wait.. It's an impressive buffet establishment. The prices here are way too high for the quality of food they offer. For authentic exceptional Japanese Cuisine, this is a great place. Yup, I'm angry that we ordered something called orange chicken with FRIED rice and this so called fried rice is an insult to the palate.. The outside looks outdated. The green tea was really good. The bathrooms were as dirty as your boyfriends mind. Very friendly atmosphere. Delivery is fast and friendly. *Most restaurants serve only white race, but they also gave us the option for brown rice with our meals. The Chicken and the broccoli was perfect. This a simply a wonderful family oriented restaurant with a good personality and warm atmosphere. The crab puffs are insane. Over-priced, bad service and horrible food. Overall the service was superior, attentive but not intrusive. we were serverd by a waitress, who was as rude as they can be. Very slow to serve. The honey shrimp was the best I've ever had. Hardly any beef, the veggies were all previously frozen. Everything from the tables to the bathrooms is clean.  And while I didn't get sick, I sort of doubt that all the health codes are being followed.. But the costumer service is horrible great thing it's only takeout!. There is an unpleasant sour smell when you walk in. All of the food was very greasy and tasteless. Disgusting Chinese springroll. The atmosphere is nice and casual, and fits the place well.. The only negative about this is it seems like their A/C was not running that fully. Service is where this restaurant needs much improvement. Price is a bit high. Their coffee is really great and strong - I'm a big fan. My boyfriend got sweet and sour chicken which also was poor quality and was not good. On our visit, they were out of brown rice and the service was a little off. The taste was very very weird. The noodle dish the BF ended up with (spicy garlic) was pretty bland tasting though. My chicken was so plain. it is horrible disgusting and spoiled food. I really liked the fresh orange juice they offered. I actually went to Taco Bell to get the taste of this shitty Chinese food out of my mouth. The orange chicken was just nasty. They hat really great exotic beers. Their waitstaff is always outstanding. Our food was horrible. Curry chicken just wasn't good. Very attentive server. he owners clearly feel that using cheap second rate ingredients is the only way to make money. Overall quality was good but the green tea that they offered wasn't good. Love what they have done to this place - the decoration is so much cooler now. You can tell the noodles are fresh. the tea was not nice. I advise to call ahead as wait time could be lengthy. *They have a 20% off coupon periodically. The decor is as hideous as any other Chinese restaurant we've been to, but it's very clean and the owner and wait staff are wonderful. The seafood is just ok. Although they advertise specials, these specials are not cheaper than the regular dish. The tap beer they offered was stale. Their lunch is a pretty good deal. Best egg rolls on the west coast, hands down. The staff is super nice, very attentive, always quick to take your order or get a drink. The carpets were so stained and dirty  - really disgusting. But again, the chicken was tough and the soup had no flavor. Lovely architecture and decor. The prices are reasonable, and the owners are very friendly.. The quality of the items seemed to be quite good. Our server wasn't pleasant at all. The price range is awesome. This was an odd taste for this dish that I've had many times at other places. Ordered the chicken bowl and the chicken was extremely dry. Great flavor and huge portion. The furniture is very nice and comfortable. Rickie was pleased with his dish though for the life of me I cannot remember what it was. Tables were boxed frames with clear tops and there was crumbs under clear tops in boxes....Not very appealing. questionable neighborhood. *The only thing is the restroom needed attention. Called them and got some bullshit response. Sweet and sour sauce was watery and not the excellent thick version a couple of weeks ago. It was sticky, tasteless, and the chicken was very chewy. Good food, friendly service, and inexpensive cost. The portions are simply huge, and the quality is very good. The place was busy but service was crappy. the fried rice was really good. It is a relaxing place tho.  I am very unhappy with my service. This place has authentic Szechwan cuisine. Service was horrible. the noodles tasted awful. Clean, great food, generous portions, super employees, unbelievable prices, and they grill their chicken...everything isn't drowned in oil. Fabulous food!. Some of the food was coldish. I really liked the healthy lunch options. this is the worst Chinese I have ever had. Yes I guess it was food court after all, but that still does not make it right to have bad customer service.. And something they think is Gen Tso's chicken that was beyond bad. Relaxing atmosphere, beautiful interior and serene background music.. They shouldn't be so stingy with the ice, our cups literally had like 3 cubes per cup, and when they refilled our water, there was no ice in it at all. Paid 43.00 for a dinner, that was basically uneatable. But they seated us quickly, took our order promptly and it wasn't too long of a wait for the meal to arrive. The sauce wasn't gummy and the vegetables were nice and crisp. Canton Wong has the best delivery Chinese food. It's definitely a great value. Great price for the amount of food that you get.. Our waiter was super friendly and very outgoing. The ambiance inside the restaurant is very relaxing and the staff is welcoming and friendly.. the atmosphere was stressful. It was also a bit loud and cramped inside, but definitely worth a visit for the food. The waiter was rude as fuc*.
