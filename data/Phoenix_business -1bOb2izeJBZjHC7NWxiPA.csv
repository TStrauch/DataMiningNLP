"One word: Bacado.  Bacon, avocado and cheese in an omelet.  Seems common place, but no other restaurant does it so well. Breakfast and brunch only. When I was younger I thought First Watch was a local restaurant that started at this location because they had several menu items with hospital 'themed' names and with some of my family working at the hospital, it seemed like it must have been created just for them.  I was dashed to find out it wasn't true.  This is still my favorite First Watch location, and I thnk should be listed somewhere as 'Best place to choke on your ham' or 'Best place to meet a single Dr.'  or something because it's littered with hospital staff.  Not that there's anything wrong with that... I love everything on the menu.  I love how fresh everything tastes and how healty it (almost) all seems.  I didn't realize the limits of the menu until I went there for breakfast with someone who doens't eat eggs.  Wow. There goes 90% of the menu.  Not that a breakfast/lunch place has to have tons of non-egg options, but if someone is looking for an alternative, it's pretty much just pancakes, or order something from the lunch menu.  nnService has always been good, though rushed at times.  Wonder if any of these folks are just working here to meet the Dr's of their mother's dreams?  Could be interesting to find out... A previous reviewer mentioned Ihop and Denny's.  Right on.  Might as well mention LePeep and other bland, vanilla, overcrowded 'restaurants' too.  All I will say is this: Until you've had a waitress dripping with sweat (Dripping!) deliver your food, you can't complain.  So, I guess we CAN complain.  Grow up...Go someplace real. First Watch is always a reliable place to hit after a night of binging or a moderate bout of dysentery, as you can always expect the food to be bland but healthful.  Barely anything on the menu is slathered in grease, which is a nice change from some of FW's competitors.  I'm not totally slamming the place: I actually like the combos they offer in terms of the sweet-savory equilibrium that's so important to me when breakfast is concerned.  The retirement home-style pastels are soothing, too.  You might expect Dorothy, Rose, and Blanche to sit down in the booth next to you at any moment. A big FW plus is that generous seating ensures that there are barely any times when you have to wait to be seated for breakfast or lunch.  So if you can't get a seat at nearby Matt's Big Breakfast or the Park Central Good Egg, consider this egg joint. Ive been 4 times it think last time was yesterday.... OK so the Good........some good creative menu choices....ah a Fajitas crepe was interesting.... nBAd: nBugs on table....straw wrapper in water? (-1 star)nntraditional food Eggs Benedick.... terribly bland....and different food that Fajita crepe thing also not good.....(-1 star) nnHours....um close at 2:30pm? I give points for havening long hours and good food this place has neither....(-1 star)nnIt not the worst but I can't recommend it anymore.... I used to go to First Watch once a week and I strongly recommend this place.  The pancakes are to die for and the service is first rate.  It i one of the few breakfast places that keeps it real with the sausage, and serves it up many ways (links, patties, chorizo, etc).  One of my favorite places in the valley. I really like this place for breakfast.  There is almost never a wait for a table, even on Saturday morning.  The food and service is reliable.  There are some healthy options on the menu as well as some very not healthy options (which we all sometimes need and want for breakfast).  One of my close friends introduced me to this restaurant years ago.  As it is downtown, it was awfully out of my way to go again.  But, I always thought of it fondly.  Now, that I am only minutes from downtown - I think I will be getting here more often.  I'm almost glad that there are several poor reviews on yelp because it secures my ability to wander in and get a table whenever I please! :) I've eaten there many times.  Nice people.  Good food.  They give you your own pitcher of water & carafe of coffee [very nice touches]!  Reasonable prices. My co worker and I were driving around Phoenix looking for an Ihop and stumbled upon First Watch.  Good thing we did because it was well worth the breakfast stop considering their reasonable prices, good variety, free pitcher of coffee at our table, and very friendly service.  I had something called a Crepegg which is a thin sweet crepe combined with fluffy whipped eggs.  It kind of tastes like an omelet but not really since it has the crepe batter in it.  But my Key West Crepe was very satisfying with avocado, bacon, smoked turkey, tomatoes, and monterey jack cheese.  I did also want to try the banana crunch with granola pancake but you can only eat so much in one sitting!!! As far as chain breakfast spots go, this isn't half bad. I'd pick it over the Good Egg for dxc3xa9cor alone, which is much less country kitchen and more...well...this location looks kind of strange. It's like walking into an 80s after-school soda fountain shaped like a Der Wienerschnitzel. The food? Not mind-blowing, but well above average, too. The eggs are cooked just right, and I happen to think the fresh veggies in the omelettes are about as crisp and tasty as you're going to find. The coffee is on par with Denny's, so take that for what it's worth. I'll take this over an IHOP any day, that's for sure. First Watch is good for a light breakfast as they really don't pile on the food.  The food is good though and the service is good too. This is near my downtown condo, which is convenient since I can eat here multiple times a week without tiring of it. Free newspapers, great service and friendly staff who remembers their 'regular' customers, breakfast all day and huge glasses of iced tea - adds up to a very enjoyable, affordable meal. this place reminds me of a more refined dennys. run of the mill breakfast spot. you wouldn't be missing out on much if you never ate here, and i only came here because the place i really wanted to get breakfast at had an hour wait. i couldn't find any breakfast item that looked particularly appetizing, so i went with the buffalo chicken wrap. my gf ordered the choco chip pancake, and a side of scrambled eggs and ham. food came out, nothing special, taste and looks wise. my buffalo chicken wrap was overloaded with lettuce and lacked a suitable amount of chicken. the buffalo sauce was different than any i've ever had and wasn't very spicy. the bleu cheese crumbles were good though. i ordered a side of bleu cheese dressing and it came out looking like mayo. i don't know if i can ever eat bleu cheese after that. my gfs pancake was a ok nothing really stood out. our sever was awesome though. everyone inside was very friendly. i appreciate good service. Well... The food may have been a little closer to the mediocre side, but the service was great! I had what my gf always says as a 'boring breakfast'. Chocolate chip pancakes, and a side of ham and an egg. The pancake was a little dry but the ham was pretty good. Coffee was average, eggs were average. But they did have some decent things on the menu. I do like that they brought out an entire carafe of coffee, and water so I don't get stuck paying 2 bucks for a tiny cup-o-joe w/ no refill, or trying to flag someone down for one. Nice! But our server was great. She apologized for the OJ spilled all down the side of her previous to our visit. It did look bad though. lol. When I went to pay they were the guy asked me how everything was and what I had planned today. I sincerely appreciate people who enjoy their job, and make your experience enjoyable. In short: Service, 5 stars.... Food 3 stars... we used to go here every Sunday...but, something happened a few months ago and all of a sudden the wait staff turned over and the service just went to crap.  The Manager did buy us breakfast once and encouraged us to return...AND WE DID..then the stupidity just multiplied like bunnies and rats.  Food is good but the staff just does not seem to give a darn about you getting your drinks or food.... Don't waste your time Phoenix Downtowners.....go to Good Egg Nice, respectable breakfast place near Encanto park. It has a basic, chain brunch place feel, but with the friendly servers, somehow it seemed a bit more homey. Seats are basic wooden booths and the inside seems a bit cooler and darker than you'd expect for a bright Phoenix morning. The menu is basic breakfast fare and I had a version of the Denver omelette with english muffins on the side. There was also a potato side that came with it: for the life of me, I believe it was homefries, but I'm not 100%. Obviously it wasn't too memorable, but I thought everything here was at least average. Prices were reasonable and they dropped a coffee canteen at my table (and even refilled it when I had drank the whole thing) for easy access. So, not a meal that you'll remember for the rest of your life, but there won't be any nightmares here either...... We made a trip to First Watch on the way to the airport to take our daughter so she could catch a flight to Texas.  I know what you are thinking...'why would anyone want to go to Texas on purpose?'.  She really does have a good reason, so off we went.  We walked in and they seated us right away.  Our waitress promptly greeted us and took our drink order.  She introduced herself as 'Lindsay', and I am sure she is not the 'Milkoholic Lindsay' from the E-Trade commercial.  She did a great job for us.  Our food came out quickly and it was quite tasty.  Lindsay checked on us quite a few times as we ate and refreshed our drinks. We will be returning for another visit.   nnThe valley needs more places that have a good to great breakfast...! FRIENDLY, FAST SERVICE AND GREAT FOOD. NEIGHBORHOOD FAVORITE. --eggs overcookedn--oj watery but tastyn--food not greasy or oilyn--everything just a little bit healthier than you'll find elsewhere. Food is great. Service has always been slow...even when the restaurant is not busy. Haven't been back in months.  however, the last 2 times i have gone, the service has been much quicker so i increase from 3 stars to 4!  and downtown location is across the street from golds gym downtown so i may frequent much more. This place is just fine.  You will have a decent breakfast.  Their coffee is great, they have lots of different flavored creamers and the food is fine. We got tired of paying $20 for breakfast at the big named hotels across the street.  We tried this place out and never ate at the hotels again, even if the boss was paying. Certainly worth a trip if you're stuck in downtown for a few days. A coworker of mine selected this restaurant as her birthday lunch destination when I offered to treat. And what the birthday girl wants, the birthday girl gets... so off we went! This was literally my First Watch - I had never even heard about this place until she mentioned it. The inside is just as some other reviewers have pointed out, very cafeteria like yet still cheerfully bright. It definitely gives off a 'Good Day Sunshine' breakfast vibe. We sat down in a not so comfortable cafeteria style booth, and I began to scan the menu. The options looked decent but boring, and spanned the spectrum of usual omelet, egg, bacon, pancake, griddle, wrap, sandwich and salad dishes. First Watch also has 'The Healthier Side' - a portion of their menu dedicated to those watching their waistline. I thought that was a nice touch. The coffee tasted like warm water with brown food coloring in it, very unimpressive. I ordered the No. 5 - an Asian salad with chicken, romaine lettuce (yuck), wontons, cashews, cilantro and carrots with the ginger sesame dressing on the side. This salad was not impressive at all, and it needed more toppings to combat the bland romaine lettuce. I just picked at it throughout the entire meal. The birthday girl ordered the Black 'n Blue Wrap - roast beef, blue cheese, tomato, lettuce and horseradish sauce wrapped up in a spinach tortilla. She was impressed with her meal, so maybe I should have gotten a wrap instead! However, I probably won't go back for my Second Watch to find out. Overall, First Watch is decent. The service is fast yet friendly and the food is mediocre. The breakfasty-brunchy-lunchy menu was a step up from an IHOP or Denny's because First Watch's food isn't as greasy. So if I had to compare, I would say First Watch's menu resembles The Good Egg's menu - although I think that The Good Egg's food quality, presentation and flavor is much better. If you're looking for a breakfast place open early in that general area, I suggest you drive a little further up Central to the Park Central Shopping center and hit up The Good Egg. In my opinion, their salads are tastier and their coffee is stronger. I happen to really like this place for breakfeast. I have been going to this location  and the other location for years and always happy with my meal. I used to get the Bubbas Benny which is biscuits and gravy with eggs and potatoes. But now they make it with turkey sausage so I dont get it anymore. Now I get the eggs benidict. Its good and the hollandaise sauce doesnt have a lot of lemon in it. Im not a fan of lots of lemon in my hollandaise. The waffles and french toast here are good as well. This place has burgers, salads, and sandwiches to. Prices are good. $5-10. I dont think they have anything over $10 on the menu. Nice sized parking lot. Friendly staff. i mean, it's just average. lots of old people. lots of regulars. i wish i could give 5 stars solely for our waitress. in fact, i'm going to write the manager to tell them about our awesome waitress. seriously, who cares about the food. i want to be her bff4l, she was so damn nice. apparently everyone loves her bc the regular oldies were hugging her and she knew them all by name. i have NEVER had such a great waitress. for sure, the best, ever. the food was neither here nor there...just typical breakfast stuff... but i would go back just to hang out with my new bff4l. i wish i knew her name, but if you go here just ask for the blonde girl that everyone loves, you will love her too. and you will also want to be her bff4l. We went here for breakfast last weekend and I was pleasantly surprised. The coffee is there own brand and it has a great flavor. I especially like that they have a bunch of different flavored creamers. nThe staff is very friendly and efficient. You can tell this is the type of place that has regulars. I also like that they have both breakfast and lunch items to choose from. nI had the Key West Crepe egg. The crepe egg is a mixture between a thin crepe and whipped eggs and it was stuffed with turkey, bacon, avocado, tomatoes and probably some other goodies. It came with hash browns and an english muffin. My husband had the traditional breakfast which is pretty much what it sounds like. Overall I would recommend First Watch because it's a great breakfast at a good price with friendly staff. I used to come here quite often and really enjoyed it. However, something happened and they really went down hill. I went there again about 3 weeks ago after not going there for years and it was really good. So we went there again this week. Again really good, the food has greatly improved!  Everything  once again was delicious and the service was fantastic.  I am so glad that they got it together again. They are only open for Breakfast and lunch. But, i love that they are right here in the neighborhood. First Watch is a local chain that serves up average breakfast food. This place isn't terrible, but it is also not remarkable in any way. The booths are made of slotted wood, and for some reason they haven't been updated in years, resulting in sub-par seating that will leave horizontal lines on anyone wearing shorts. The food is ok, not exciting or great, just ok. The coffee is bad, it looks like coffee but tastes like brown water. Additionally they don't have fresh half&half, they have the little individual cups similar to Circle K. For this visit, the HUGE downfall was the service. I won't describe this person because I don't want any harm coming to her job, but if our server wasn't on meth, then I don't like cupcakes (HINT- I love cupcakes). The server was jittery, confused and racing around unnecessarily. Making things more annoying, the booth near us apparently had some of the servers friends dining, and they were so loud, I thought I was at a club. When we were seated the server yelled over to us asking us for a drink order. For the next ten minutes she sat with her pals and cackled about something they were watching on a smart phone. It was sketchy too because they started talking pretty loudly about sex acts, and other things that aren't the best fit when there are tables of kids within five feet. I have a great sense of humor, but 11:00am on a Saturday isn't the best time to get cheeky at breakfast. In a different restaurant, they might politely ask the people who are yelling loudly and having inappropriate conversations to dial it down, but here the server was sitting with them, and was part of it.  Interestingly, all the other staff we encountered were very nice and appropriate, but our server was SO poor, that it just couldn't save the outing. Our food was brought to us by a lovely server who we wished would have been ours from the start. After our food was brought out, our server never stopped by again. It was funny however, that she had to walk by our table five times to go back and sit with her friends, and cackle some more- but couldn't stop to see if we needed more water (yes) Luckily my dining pal has a sense of humor and just rolled her eyes, but I would be livid if I brought my Mom, etc. there. In closing, I cannot recommend this place for a meal. It's not terrible, but with the economy being so sketchy, it's nice to spend money somewhere that is comfortable and where you're not ignored, or served by someone who likely cannot pass a drug test. I took my dad here for breakfast when he came into town for the morning. I actually took him here based solely on the location because it was close to my house.  The food is ok, I had the 'traditional' breakfast with scrambled eggs, turkey sausage and potatoes.  The egg were just ok, didnt really have flavor and were kind of dry, I wonder do they add milk to their eggs? If you're looking for a delicious cafe/diner type of breakfast/lunch place with good prices, then go to First Watch in midtown Phoenix.  The food and coffee and is fantastic, I've never had a bad meal their. Probably one of my favorite places to go for Eggs Benedict. Every server I've ever had there has been on point, and smiling. I thought it was surprisingly cheap for how good the food was. Lots of variety and choices on the menu. Easy access and plenty of parking. Very consistent place for breakfast with the kids.  Pancakes are always terrific, and I like that I can order a single pancake (they're HUGE; if you're eating a stack of these, be prepared for a nap).  Servers are always super-friendly, and very attentive if the place isn't jammed.  Kids' meals are a terrific deal.   Nice that they have flavored creamers to go with the coffee.  Not as funky & flavorful as Matt's Big Breakfast, but no wait, and a lot cheaper. First Watch offers the standard American breakfasts.  It's good stuff.  What I noticed about this restaurant is the consumer service.  Albert's customer service skills are second to none.  Dude asked me what my name was, shook my hand and referred to me by my first name every time he came by to see how I was doing.  I recommend this restaurant. I am totally in love with their fresh brewed mango iced tea, it is really good. Their food is more on the healthy side and offers some choices that are not on most breakfast/lunch spots. I have tried their eggs benedict with turkey & avocado and it was wonderful. The turkey here tastes fresh roasted and is sliced super thin. Also had their waffle...wow!! its light, fluffy, and not too sweet. Comes with hot syrup and a fruit compote. Service here is excellent all around, even when they are super busy. I will be back here again and again. It's bland old white people food, if you like that sort of thing ;) Sort of like a more pricey version of Denny's. Other than the atmosphere, I don't have too much positive to say about First Watch.  The eggs were disgusting! They were bright yellow and had the most bizarre texture.  You would have thought they were feeding the chickens fabric softener.  I had a carrot cake pancake, which i thought was a pretty clever idea. Unfortunately, it was multi-grain.  Let me tell you, a multi-grain carrot cake pancake is just a bit too much going on for me.  The service was fair but far from great.   Overall, far from a wow, I wouldn't go out of my way to come back. 2.5 stars. I was shocked to see the low ratings about First Watch.  We have been here dozens of times and the food and service have always been top notch.  It is consistently great.  I will continue to support this great breakfast and lunch spot.  Special recognition to the servers-everyone is so friendly, positive and laid back. Every weekend I come to First Watch and the service is always outstanding. I usually have one of two regular waitresses and they are always so nice and cheerful. The food is always good and quickly served. If you want a decent breakfast in a nice happy environment then go here. I'm here pretty regularly for a breakfast meeting, so I've grown pretty well acquainted with the joint. If I were rating it on service alone, it'd be a solid 5 stars. The waitstaff are always attentive and friendly, have answered questions I didn't even ask (thank you, psychic bathroom directions buddy!) , and know the menu well. They don't even bat an eye at special requests. No matter what size group we end up having, the servers and the kitchen both cope well, too, which is always rad. The food, alas, isn't as standout awesome as the service. It's not bad by any means. It's edible and tastes good and comes out at the appropriate temperature. The menu's got a great variety. It's just not anything to write home about. If you asked me 'Where can I get a reliably decent breakfast,' First Watch would be at the top of the heap. If you want a mind-blowingly amazing breakfast, not so much. it's a healthy breakfast all day looking joint.  Remind me of sunrise cafe in Vegas.   very friendly service and prompt.  Definitely a good spot to go. Solid place to grab a classic breakfast. Nice selection with seasonal choices. Had the Pumpkin Pancakes with some herbal tea. Fresh food, attentive staff and boy is it fast!  I like the skillets and they'll sub out my toast for fruit, which is nice.  I never feel like I ate heavy, sticky, icky food when I leave and I like that. Every single employee you encounter interacts with you with a big ol' smile on their face.  There is ONE wait person who is a little ditzy and I try to avoid her like the plague, but overall I am very impressed with this place.  Not a greasy diner, no siree!nnTasty!  I'd eat lunch here sometime too but their gluten free lunch options are just about non-existent.  I wish they'd change that. The staff is super friendly and helpful. The food is great and out quickly. Coffee is always hot & tasty! This is our go-to breakfast spot! Plus you can sub almost anything, including egg whites, for no extra charge. They're very accommodating, especially for those of us who have to eat gluten free. So happy we found First Watch! My go-to place when I want plenty of breakfast options & 0-little waiting time to be seated. No matter how full it looks like it is, I've only had to wait to be seated once & that took all of 5 minutes. This is a breakfast & lunch restaurant & is not open for diner. I must confess, no matter what time I've been, I always have breakfast, so that's all I can review :DnMy favorite omelet is new on their menu, the Ce La Vie. It's  roasted zucchini, onions and tomatoes with herbed goat cheese. It comes with just the right amount of potatoes and an english muffin. I always switch out the muffin for wheat toast. nWhen I'm ravenous & I want something a little heavier, I like the bacon and onion hash. n nThe staff is always so friendly & our waitress always remembers us, even when she's not our waitress :) Good breakfasts options. They have your classics and some tasty healthy alternatives too. Great place for breakfast and a cup of coffee. The ladies here are amazing and super nice. They bring out my food in a timely manner and the eggs benedict there are to die for. During the Fall/Winter season, they have a specials menu that was delicious. If they still have it I recommend trying the pulled pork sandwich and the butternut squash soup. meals are reasonable priced, and if you go online and subscribe to their newsletter you get a buy one get one entree coupon for your next visit, and you get a free entree on your birthday. This place never disappoints. Yummy as always.  I had the Turkey Chive Crepe Eggs.  It was great.  I wish they still had the California Delight on the menu.  That was my favorite. This is the location nearest my work and I was surprised to get 1) a parking spot and 2) a table with no wait.  It is right across from St. Joe's and it is always packed.  But apparently 12:40 is the time to go.  Darn, I gave away the secret. Great healthy breakfast! I love this place. I had sourdough french toast with kiwi, strawberries, bananas, and blueberries with a side of eggs ($1.59 for an egg? Really? I can buy a dozen for that much!)nnAnyway, pricy eggs aside, it was SO DELICIOUS. I ate the entire thing, even every last crumb of fruit. I loved it. It was reasonably priced, I got unlimited tea refills, and the server was just the cutest thing I've ever seen. It was like a very very nice and quaint version of denny's in terms of layout, not a lot of trendy indie stuff or whatever, but i loved it. This is a Breakfast ,Lunch place that used to be beyond Great!nWe really loved coming here many years ago.nThe same people worked here and it was always a pleasure to come in.nFood was wonderful and so was the service. Then things started to change. The food was not as good,nThey changed the menu up.  Then the staff started to change.nWhen you start losing all the staff you have had for so many years something is not right inside the company.nThe service and food really went downhill.nSo we stopped coming here. Well, lately I have been back 2x's. Things are better. They are trying.nBut, it is still not the same. However, service is fast again, and they do check on you all the time. Food is working it self back up the hill.nMaybe they should fo more organic or something.nIt is still a good place, just not what it was. Whenever I come to First Watch I feel like I'm going to a little diner.  The service is great and the food is great too.  They have a great selection of egg white omelets that you can choose from.  nnMy favorite thing about First watch is that they leave you the whole pot of coffee at your table.  :)  The turkey sausage and egg white omelet is really good.  nnWhile if you are in the area and when some breakfast.  You should come here.  It is definitely better then Ihop or Denny's. amazing food and great staff. try the banana blitz if it is still around when you go Tried this place for the first time this morning and it exceeded all ny expectations! I'm not usually the diner type, but the quality of food and commitment top great service will have me back here on a regular basis. Best breakfast/brunch place since I lived in Palo Alto in the 1980s.nDifferent types of dishes.  WHOLE GRAINS,which I love.  Great service.  Not cheap, but worth it! Every chance I get to eat here, I do.  I wish there was one in Tucson.  I order the same thing everytime.  I love the Killer Cajun. I went to first watch for first time and will not be back. I ordered the Chickichanga. The potatoes were burned. I also feel like they were frozen potatoes. The chicken I had inside felt like rubber. And tasted just like frozen Tyson chicken. I felt like I was on an episode of restaurant impossible where I had to taste and criticize the terrible food. The service was not as wonderful as everyone is saying. Yes they were nice but that's all. The host sat us in the very back of the restaurant when there was clearly room towards the front for us to sit. It took at least 10 min for anyone to come to us. After we got our food about 15 min later the waitress brought our bill. It felt as if they were trying to rush us out. But by then I was disgusted by the food I honestly was ready. But hey the water was good. What a great place to eat, food was great. I had the eggs benedict and had a special request to add spinach to it. They said no problem.  Was very good.  Portions just right. Very good. Had the lunch 2fer combo, turkey sandwich and pecan salad. Both were amazing. I added on a cup of tomato bisque that I used for dipping the sandwich in. Delish!nn (: Came to First Watch after a bad experience with The good egg. 1000x better.nUnlike other places, the food isn't greasy and doesn't give me a stomach ache afterwards. Lots of options and you can order breakfast or lunch any time of the day! nOur waitress told us: 'If we can do it,  we will'.nShe even let us order the Turkey Dill Crepegg even though it's not on the menu any more. nI will keep coming here! I recommend it any day.nI'm just bummed they close at 2 30 :( It was ok I guess. I had the huevos rancheros, hubby had the traditional breakfast. nFor me - the beans tasted like canned beans, the tortilla tasted store bought like mission tortillas & the chorizo was a tablespoon so more beans than anything. My over-easy eggs, sliced avocados & potatoes were probably the only thing fresh. Oh, and the pico de gallo was pretty good. So overall it was alright for the amount of serving you get & $. If you're starving it'll fill you up. Most likely won't visit again.nHusband said it was bland but did the job (after adding salt, pepper & hot sauce) since he was starving. Apart from the food, the service surpassed the food! :) There may be other breakfast places that are more unique, have better individual menu items, or are more compelling for one reason or another. But over the years, this place has consistently provided great healthy meals and excellent, fast, friendly service. I have never had a bad experience here and have always left wondering why I don't come back here more often. Then I go and try some new trendy breakfast joint, only to realize I would have been better off coming back to First Watch instead. My personal favorite dish is the Chickichanga, but I've eaten half the stuff on the menu and it's all been really good. And I particularly enjoy the fact that no matter what I eat there, I never feel like I just ingested 9lbs of cheese and grease when I'm done. It's all light and healthy and fantastic. Great service the staff all have great smiles.  Oatmeal and turkey sausage links with black coffee.  The pecans and cranberries make the oatmeal tasty Amazing and cheap breakfast. Everything was fresh and delicious. You get your own personal coffee pot for your table. The service was outstanding! Our waitress was so sweet and even offered a to go cup for my coffee. We ate here because it was across the street from St. Joseph's hospital where our baby was in intensive care. Had the Parma Hash. It was amazing!!! I love the server Tomara! She has an awesome personality. She noticed my hospital bracelet and we told her about our baby and she was sweet enough to say a prayer for him. I would definitely recommend this restaurant. It has a friendly happy environment. The service is amazing as well as the food. Everything I have tried so far has been perfected in taste and presentation. I love breakfast, and First Watch does it right.  I had a hard time deciding because there were so many healthy options, along side heartier food.  Service was good.  I'll be back! Really good with good healthy options! I had the chikichimi which was wonderful! Came with fruit to finish tha job whaaaaaaaaaattttt A special place for breakfast when we lean away from bacon and ham. Good food, not located on 61 and Thomas, the address is 3rd and Thomas. Key West Crepegg, is really good. The food is always been amazing there and they have great dealnWhen my wife wants to go out to breakfast that is where we gonnThe omelettes are the best Great service, food, and reasonably priced.. The Belgian Waffle was one of the best I have ever had, we had a great waiter very attentive n quick with all request. Will b back again.. A lot of food from breakfast places tend to taste of fatigue and depressed cooks, but not here. Food tastes fresh, nice portions, and great variety on omelettes and sandwiches. Waffles and pancakes taste fresh and fluffy, and helps with the depression of being in Downtown Phoenix. The staff is always great--feels like a folksy 1950's movie because they're mostly moms who ply on the coffee and food and tell you to eat your veggies. Had the Parm hash, with a Pecan Pancake. Hash was amazing, and was a large plate. Pancake was decent, but overall great breakfast spot. Great service. For this area and especially for those in walking distance working at the hospital this place is a must visit. I am consistently surprised at the intriguing new dishes that arrive for specials. They got my order wrong but the dish they brought was delicious all the same. Quinoa pasta dish with a lemon sauce and fresh white meat chicken grilled on top. Also had the squash soup that tickled the tastebuds pink. Ignore the lackluster exterior and give this place a try. Been here for breakfast many times.  Lunch only a few.  Great American food with speedy service and fair prices.   Only four stars because of the wait on the weekends which actually shows how good this place really is. Never been during the week but it would be a regular lunch destination if I worked downtown. As mentioned in previous reviews, I love breakfast for lunch. The other day I had only 30 minutes for lunch between meetings. I was going to test my luck to see if I can order and consume an omelet within 30 minutes. I usually go to The Good Egg for breakfast for lunch but decided I would give First Watch a try. The experience was satisfactory but not great. Server was polite enough but no personality. He did constantly fill my water which was a plus and he got my order in and food brought out quickly and efficiently. I ordered a veggie omelet with a side of potatoes. Omelet was okay but a bit bland. Thank God for hot sauce. The broccoli inside the omelet was raw which I found unappealing. A nice saute, steam, or roast to them would have made this omelet 10x better. The potatoes it came with were obviously previously frozen, lacked seasoning, and unevenly cooked. The good news is that I was in and out of there in under 25 minutes. I don't think I will return on my own to First Watch. I find the food to be tastier and the service friendlier at The Good Egg. Our first visit--loved it and we'll be back.  The food was prepared exactly as ordered.  We love having a coffee pot on the table.  Overall, a great breakfast experience. I'm going to make this one short and sweet. This restaurant has GOOD FOOD.  nnIt's not what I would call fancy or gourmet but it's that kind of place that you know you and your group is not going to be disappointed. We have been there a couple of times and there is always a wait but never too long and it is always worth it!nnThe HASH breakfast's are my personal favorite and everything about them tastes 100% homemade.  If you are one of those who really likes hash but asks if it's canned because you don't like the kinda salty mushed stuff with little tiny chopped potatoes,  Well you are going to LOVE this place because it is truly homemade and well portioned and full bodied with great flavor!nnThere is always more than enough food to go around; we are big boys and like to eat and start our vacation days with good food for breakfast and have never been disappointed here. When ever in Phoenix I think we eat here at least once..... we always try new places because we are adventurous but First Watch is the place that comes to mind if there is any question or if you've had a bad meal you always think, I should have just eaten there.... I would also say they are the masters of comfort food!nnGood food time and again that you can count on. Thank you!!! Wow. Really great hash! I appreciate that this brunch place gives you a seasonal menu outside of their regular fare. The benches in the place are a little shallow, and I'm a big guy, so there was slight discomfort; however, the quality of service and food quickly made me forget any tweaks I would make to the seating situation. The portions are great, and even an arugula salad was elevated and tasty. We'll definitely be coming back! Best breakfast, brunch, lunch, service in town! Affordable and great for kids. The staff is super professional and kind, Any plate you order will be delicious. Never disappoints. My favorite place for brunch for sure! My favorite breakfast stop in central Phoenix.  The pancakes are huge, the coffee is smooth and flavorful.  Service is friendly and your food is out super quick.  My breakfast faves are the various omelette sand scrambles, but my sinful guilty pleasure there is The Monte Christo.  Ask for extra preserves/jelly as it gives a great contrast in flavor.  It's probably the best Monte Christo I've ever had. We hit up First Watch this morning and my first thought was, 'boy! what a popular joint!' The wait was quoted at 10-15 minutes but we were seated in else than ten. Service was excellent. Jenny enjoyed the waffle breakfast and I had an Acapulco Express omelette. Both were good and we cleared out plates, sipping on the coffee (caution: it's a strong brew) to wrap up our casual Saturday breakfast. Not a lot of bells and whistles but First Watch seems to know what they're doing. Definitely a safe bet if you're looking for a dependable weekend breakfast stop. I love first watch! We would go every Saturday when I lived in St. Louis and when I moved to Los Angeles I looked to see where the nearest one was and well I made the drive just to get a little bit of home!!!!nnI never need a menu! I always order the trifecta with a side of potatoes and a coffee!!! It's always on point and sometimes I add a little fruit!! nnFirst watch is is always grade A! Stopped in for a late breakfast because I saw a review for this place.  I must say, the highlight was the multigrain carrot cake pancake.  Wow!  Server was on the border of unfriendly, but the rest of the staff were great.1  Will try it again. First Watch is really the best spot in the area for breakfast. nI've never had a wait on a weekday. The service is quick-- actually, it's instantaneous! There's never a wait for more coffee as they give you your own thermos of quality coffee!nI've not been adventuresome with the menu, sticking always to their reliable 'Traditional' breakfast, going with the sausage links. If you too rebel against the all-too commonplace and tasteless Sysco 'sausage' patties, you'll love these delicious sausages. They cook them perfectly at First Watch.nYou'll have plenty of room in their booths whether you're dining alone with your work-papers all spread out, or sitting with others. Noise level is perfect for having a meeting over a meal.nFirst Watch servers are first-rate pros, a perfect balance of down-to-business attention accompanied by a friendly smile but without the overlay of fake and distracting, cutesy chitchat. nEverything in the place is clean; the whole operation is well-organized and everything I've ordered has been delicious. You can't go wrong. I've just realized I've never Yelped FW! What a tragedy!nnFW is my absolute favorite breakfast place in the WORLD. Really. The food is seriously fresh and top of the line, the service is unbeatable, the atmosphere is friendly, comfy, and nice. You can tell that all around, from frontline to kitchen staff, the place is run well. My husband and I go to FW at least two weekends a month, and bring out of town family and friends here at every chance. Everyone is always so pleased and impressed, and jealous that they don't have their own First Watch locally (ahem, FWs are needed in Oregon!)nnI'm having a hard time identifying single things to write about since I literally like every single aspect of the place.. One big positive: Tamara. She's usually our server and I feel like she goes out of her way to have us as patrons. She is SO sweet, friendly, and warm. We love getting her. The house coffee: fantastic. The waffle: stellar (do what I do and have the fruit from the Floridian French toast added to the waffle!)nnThe house potatoes: wayyyy better than regular hashbrowns. The omelets: Incredible. Tip: Sign up for their online club. FW sends me coupons on the regular and also sends me a free entrxc3xa9e certificate on my birthday. :D nnGo to First Watch. You won't regret it. Frankly when I Yelped first watch and saw all the 5/5 star reviews I was VERY confused. It has a very average updated diner vibe (think Denny's with a bit of class). nI went this morning around 10:30 and I have to say I won't be back any time soon. nPROS:  VERY good service, the waitress was very attentive and happy to bring us whatever we needed.  Easy to find, right off of Thomas a crossed from the hospital. Plenty of parking. Good prices, about 8-10$ per entree. Nice sized portions as well.  nCONS: Let me first say that the coffee was not good. I am an avid coffee drinking but by no means am I a coffee 'snob'. Im not sure what was up with this coffee but it was so bitter it felt like it was coating my teeth and mouth to the point that I could no longer drink it.  However, for the record I did not ask for a new cup and Im quite sure that with 5/5 stars not all their coffee could taste this way.  nThe food was (as my grandmother would say) nothing to write home about.  I got the biscuits and turkey sausage gravy (came with a side of potatoes and eggs of your choice-I got poached).  The eggs were sitting in a little bowl with a small collection of water at the bottom (they were cooked perfectly though). The gravy and potatoes were good.  However, the advertised the biscuits as being homemade and they were rather dry. nWhile I'd give the service a 5/5, I'd have to give the food a 2.5/5.  With all the great breakfast and brunch spots around the Valley I wouldn't bother wasting your time or money at First Watch :   Quick, friendly service and a delicious pancake; is there any better way to start a morning? Breakfast yesterday before spring training baseball. Treated my wife's cousins who loved the quinoa salad and biscuits and turkey sausage gravy. Came here after seeing how busy Matt's Big Breakfast was! Virtually no wait here. Got seated all the way in the back. My only complaint about that was the back wall has a long bench that multiple tables share, and there was a little girl next to us that kept getting up, sitting down, getting up, sitting down, so the slats on the bench kept moving. Pretty annoying. But they left before long and a new group sat down that remained pretty still.nOur waitress was very friendly and spoke in a calm and happy tone. But she used some weird phrasing and kept making odd jokes. So I guess she was almost too friendly and we thought it was strange, but also entertaining.nI ordered the Tri-Fecta with a waffle, scrambled eggs (well done), and bacon. The food came out quickly and everything tasted fresh. Eggs were cooked right. The waffle even came with a side of mixed berry compote that was good. I also tried some of the bacon & cheddar pancake my friend ordered with his meal. It was REALLY good! Savory and delicious. We ended up taking half of it home.nIf we make it back here, I'd like to try the Floridian french toast... it looked pretty good. Was impressed as soon as I walked in: the lobby and restaurant are super clean, and there's a warmth about the place (think 'Cracker Barrel' but fresher, lighter, and not cluttered).  Menu is very impressive, clean eating options, and full allergen info on the website.  Had the chicken salad spinach salad (fresh and yummy) and the kale tonic on the spring menu (tastes awesome, close your eyes if you need to!). Service was super fast and prices extremely affordable.  I'm from out of town, wish I had one in my backyard! Extensive menu for a breakfast & lunch place!  So many healthy choices :). Service was fast and friendly. I ride my bike often and really appreciate that they have a bike rack in the shade.  There is also a patio that is on the East side of the building so it's not so hot. The food is great and the staff are always friendly. Be careful of the pancakes, they are like a pound each and are addictive. It was good but not particularly impressed. Got the breakfast scramble, definitely something I could have made myself at home. Biggest complaint is their potatoes! Oh my goodness you might as well order a side of fried onions. I was pulling out huge chunks of onion and the intense flavor of onion was impossible to make with ketchup or hot sauce. And apparently they are completely unable to make a side of potatoes without onions because they're pre mixed together. They were atrocious. My wife and I visit this First Watch Cafxc3xa9 regularly for breakfast while we're out for our morning walk.  The food is GREAT... lots of healthy alternatives.  The coffee is outstanding.  And the staff is super friendly.  It's always a great experience. You are seated right away. Great service. Friendly staff. Love there breakfast oatmeal. Came here on a Sunday morning. Seated quicklyfor being a bigger party. Food came out fast and delicious well be returning. Had to wait 12 min after being seated to have anyone see us. The restaurant staff were not even in a rush at this time.  We are very patient people, but that long to even take a drink order is ridiculous. I love this place! Great service every time and always excellent food. I love eating breakfast here. O o o , when it comes to breakfast , I feel like everyone has one go to place for breakfast and First Watch claimed my title. Best Breakfast place in Phoenix , I have had the pleasure of being served in. First thing which everyone must try, the hot chocolate , the best way to start your (in my case) late morning. So good and they give you a decent size mug to enjoy this drink . Now the amount of food you get is enough to cover a few meals in your day which is a big bonus. But the winning prize goes to the flexibility of the menu and the staff. I do not eat pork and if you are the type to want some meat in your omelette its hard to choose something off the menu without pork in it. First watch has plenty of substitute options and they do not count pennies on the ingredients, they stack it up.  I believe I purchased the avocado omelette and a two pancake side. The omelette, I asked if I could sub in some turkey sausage and they delivered . the plate was packed with potato , omelette and English muffin. Now the pancakes, o my was the cherry on top, best pancakes out there. Fluffy , filling and man it actually warms my heart knowing there is someone out there , who took the time to deliver those stacks. Overall great restaurant , friendly staff , whoever the owners are bravo , open up a First Watch next door to me cause I will be there everyday . also my bill was about 30 dollars for myself and my girlfriend to order breakfast with coffee and 2 hot chocolates so its not over priced and I would of paid more for that meal. I love this place! My husband and I order here more than any other restaurant! I also love that they allow us to order previous specials that are no longer on the daily menu! The quinoa bowl with sausage, kale and roasted tomatoes is delish! This little gem is a great find! The food is fresh, no microwaves and super delicious. It was around lunch when I visited and the parking lot was full. Inside the place was busy but not overly busy. We were seated right away. Decor inside was nothing to really speak of but the food is the main attraction here. I had the 'not guilty your honor' a fabulous choice. It came with a bowl of soup, today's soup was Italian wedding ball. The soup was so close to my grandmothers it was scary. Yes, it's 108 degrees outside but it was so good I had to eat every drop. The wrap was moist, fresh and super tasty. It was enough to fill me but not leaving you with that over stuffed feeling. From other dishes that were walking by and pics I've seen here, I most definitely will be back and I will tell others this IS the spot for lunch. Sadly it's too far from me to experience breakfast. Wow! So good! The place was packed and we still were seated immediately. Our waitress was so sweet and very quick with everything. The food was also delicious. Many options on the menu and so much flavor in each dish that we ordered. I had the Floridian French toast- Amazing! My daughter had a chocolate chip pancake which was also amazing! Very fluffy and it came with bacon. I ordered sausage links as extra and I liked them but my brother and father didn't. My father liked the sausage patties better. The like was much softer. Bacon was perfect. Brother had biscuits and gravy, and usually I don't care for that dish but his were yummy. Overall, excellent. It's Fall 2015. Days shorter, 'cooler', and the lizard brain threw the winter switch. Like wandering bears preparing for the snows of winter never falling in Phoenix, Sweet D and me are back to oatmeal. The blueberries of fall, surrounded by heat-transformed batter called from First Watch. We stopped in had eggs, blueberry pancake, and the banana and pecan studded First Watch oatmeal. We enjoyed every aspect of our meal, except the 'Chris does yelp*' part. Sweet D expects focused attention as we discuss dealing with 1,600 cubic feet of boxes and packing paper, as we return another 1,600 cubic feet of furniture and Stuff home. Plus pressing non-public personal events. First Watch earned star 5 from me.  The food was filling and delicious, the morning light on our table energizing, the service very good, with coffee and water carafes avaialable for self serving liquids. The prices are a bit high, the crowd a bit noisy for us. But not enough to knock a star from the First Watch skies. My grandsons and I visited this  spot in the  neighborhood for breakfast.  nJacqueline H. Food was good (8 out of 10). Service was reasonably attentive and friendly (8.5 out of 10). Atmosphere was pretty normal for a breakfast place, nothing earth shattering, but decent (7 out of 10). Bathrooms were really dirty/old (4 out of 10). Manager was very friendly and seemed to care about the business, I'd give him a 9 out of 10. Food was a bit pricey for the portion size (7 out of 10), although I didn't leave hungry. Overall I'd give First Watch a 7 out of 10. Would I go back? Yes, if there were nothing else to pique my interest to try and to review, that was close by, I'd go again to see if it's different from this experience (not that it was a bad experience). Would I run back if there were other places close by that I had not been? Not right away. But, If I wanted a good standby restaurant with decent food, a decent atmosphere, good service where I wasn't expecting to be blown away, ya, I'd stop in again. Quick, friendly service and we had awesome food. I tried the cherry chicken quinoa bowl and green tea...yum!! Love this place.  Everyone always has a smile and willing to stop at your table to make sure everything is ok even if they are not assigned to your table.  They make fresh made muffins daily. The food is healthy and delicious.  I love their house made granola.  Every time I go I want to buy a bag of it to take home. Maybe one day. First Watch is different than any other breakfast place in that it not only serves fabulous egg dishes, but the salads are unique and absolutely delicious! Quinoa and kale salad is to die for, as well as the chicken salad! I just wish this place served dessert ! But I am so thankful that I live so close to this restaurant !  Both my husband and I plan on returning again and again to sample everything on the menu...nThe staff is so friendly and helpful, and the restaurant is remarkably clean... It is a comforting place to dine!"
